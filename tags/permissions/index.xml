      <description>Cheatsheet for Linux Permission Management
Standard Permissions There are three basic permissions which are read, write and execute. And they can be granted to
 a specific user (so if you are not that user those permissions do not apply to you) a group of users (if you&amp;rsquo;re not a member of that group those permissions do not apply to you) to all other users (so if the first two do not apply - these are then the permissions you&amp;rsquo;ll have on the respective file/directory)  This is also the order in which linux checks the permissions.</description>
