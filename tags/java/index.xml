      <description>&lt;p&gt;When developing JEE applications these days we not only deploy &amp;lsquo;em as containerized apps but (at least in my teams) also use containers for local development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue I was confronted with the other day was a performance bug with one of our apps. Back in the days I&amp;rsquo;d have just fired up &lt;a href=&#34;https://visualvm.github.io/&#34;&gt;VisualVM&lt;/a&gt; to connect to the local process causing trouble - but now, the process to attach to doesn&amp;rsquo;t run locally anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ntlm Authentication in Java</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I had to integrate a java based application with a web-service that used NTLM authentication. Since this was the first time I came across NTLM I initially had to explore how to deal with that auth-scheme. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
Luckily, I finally stumbled upon the &lt;code&gt;Authenticator&lt;/code&gt;-class in Java and learned that there is build in support for NTLM already.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
