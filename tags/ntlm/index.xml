      <title>Ntlm Authentication in Java</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I had to integrate a java based application with a web-service that used NTLM authentication. Since this was the first time I came across NTLM I initially had to explore how to deal with that auth-scheme. &lt;br/&gt;
Luckily, I finally stumbled upon the &lt;code&gt;Authenticator&lt;/code&gt;-class in Java and learned that there is build in support for NTLM already.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
