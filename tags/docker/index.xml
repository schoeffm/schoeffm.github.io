      <title>Troubleshooting Containerized Java Applications via JMX</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When developing JEE applications these days we not only deploy &amp;lsquo;em as containerized apps but (at least in my teams) also use containers for local development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue I was confronted with the other day was a performance bug with one of our apps. Back in the days I&amp;rsquo;d have just fired up &lt;a href=&#34;https://visualvm.github.io/&#34;&gt;VisualVM&lt;/a&gt; to connect to the local process causing trouble - but now, the process to attach to doesn&amp;rsquo;t run locally anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Access Host From Inside a Docker Container</title>

      <description>This is more a bookmark than a post - but I&amp;rsquo;d like to write it down explicitly since everytime I need this I have to google it (and cutting through the false positivies sucks).
 From 18.03 onwards our recommendation is to connect to the special DNS name host.docker.internal, which resolves to the internal IP address used by the host.
 This was taken from the docker-for-mac documentation were you can find more details.</description>
